# Fermat-Spirals
Connected Fermat Spirals are a space filling curve that could be used for additive manufacturing. The algorithm is presented in this paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2897824.2925958.

The goal of this project is to implement the algorithm as presented in the paper and ultimately use this algorithm to generate a fill pattern for 3D printing.
